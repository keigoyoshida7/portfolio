<td>This is a sound performance where improvised music occurs
  through interaction between audience in the physical space
  and performers participating as avatars in a virtual space.
  <br>
  The objective was to utilize the virtual space as a novel interface
  in the context of musical expression.
  <br>
  The virtual space for performers to enter as avatars was constructed 
  using Unity on the Spatial platform provided by 
  the Spatial Co., Ltd.
  <br>
  The sounds generated in the virtual space were output
  through the local speakers via the virtual audio device
  BlackHole and Ableton Live.
  <br>
  Sound effects were applied during the process as the audio passed
  through  Ableton Live.<br>
  In this performance, displays and speakers were positioned at the four corners
  of the space to reproduce the virtual space's sound and visuals,
  creating an experience where the virtual and physical spaces
  appeared to be layered, resembling the real environment.
  <br>
  Within the virtual space, the performer-controlled avatar moved freely,
  and through the local camera, the avatar could observe the audience.
  <br> Upon identifying local spectators, the performer engaged in communication 
  by using voice with effects, pronouncing, dancing, waving hands, 
  and expressing emotions through various actions and movements.
  <br>
  In the exhibition space, footsteps were audibly generated in sync
  with the avatar's movement, allowing the audience to perceive through sound 
  that the avatar was moving within the virtual space.
  <br>
  As the avatar moved between displays, the audience could imagine
  the virtual space between the displays through sound, 
  allowing them to perceive a sense of spatiality in that virtual area.
  <br>
  Therefore, the audience engaged in communication with the avatar 
  by following the performer-controlled avatar's movements, 
  freely navigating the exhibition space, and dancing together.
  <br>
  As a result of such prompted actions from the audience, 
  the emergent improvised music naturally created between the audience 
  and the performer became the essence of our performance.
  <br>
  There were no fixed rules; the expression unfolded based on the rules 
  that emerged collaboratively between the performer and the audience, 
  evolving through mutual interaction.
